This is a minimalistic timetracker. **The space provided to you for
the log message will depend on the amount of elapsed time**. This will
make it easier to get some sense out of the resulting report.

You can write more than the provided space, anyway, it's just a
suggestion. But the extra text will be grayed in order to give more
sense of the actual quantity when you are reading.

You can close or reload the page, the current counter is reset, but
the log remains.

The **crumbs** button will delete all the logs. Don't be too attached
to your personal recordings!

### Time folders

Add words to the location bar, after a question mark, to start a
separate logging session. For example adding "?second client" to the
location bar will start a new session, that can be exported separately
